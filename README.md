This library provides C bindings and an API for **encoding** Webp images using Google's [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp).

It is based on [go-webp](https://github.com/kolesa-team/go-webp), but this includes and builds the libwebp C source from a versioned Git subtree.


## Update libwebp version

1. Pull in the relevant libwebp version, e.g. `./pull-libwebp.sh v1.2.0`
2. Regenerate wrappers with `go generate ./gen`
3. Delete `libwebp_src/swig` (we're not using that)
4. Update the libwebp version badge above.

## Local development

Compiling C code isn' particulary fast; if you install libwebp on your PC you can link against that, useful during development.

On a Mac you may do something like:

```bash
brew install webp
go test ./libwebp -tags dev
```
